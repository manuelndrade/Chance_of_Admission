## Summary


The group's project centers on the analysis of a university graduate admission dataset, consisting of 500 rows and 9 columns. The primary objective is to predict the chances of admission for international graduate students. The response variable in focus is the 'Chance of Admission,' a continuous variable spanning from 0 to 1. The predictors encompass GRE scores, TOEFL scores, undergraduate rating, strength of statement of purpose, strength of the letter of recommendation, undergraduate GPA, and research experience.

To achieve their goal, the group plans to employ two statistical methods. Firstly, they will utilize descriptive statistics, incorporating appropriate tables and charts to succinctly summarize the dataset. Secondly, the group intends to implement a multi-variable linear regression model to predict admission chances based on independent variables.

In the conclusion, the group opted for a linear regression model that included all predictors as continous, showcasing lower p-values by approximately 10%, leading to an enhanced predictive accuracy of around 2%.
